ULTIR consists of categories relating to; 1) crack detection, and 2) surface damage detection. The imagery contained within each category were captured under three lighting levels and three turbidity levels, resulting in nine images for each specimen. The specimens include concrete and metallic surfaces among others. This rich resource affords researchers the opportunity to efficiently gauge the performance of a damage detection method under realistic operating conditions and on relevant specimens and helps to identify the limits at which damage detection methods begin to breakdown.
